Dooderls - Doodles of Erlang Code
==================================

Think of this repository as a large blotter on a desk.
As I get ideas, I start doodling to figure out what an
erlang implementation would look like. Some sketches are
incomplete, others are very detailed.

The types of sketches may vary including some of the
following areas:

  * OTP enhancements
  * Performance comparisons
  * Algorithm examples

These sketches may later become blog entries, or actual
implementations. Whether others will find them useful or
relevant is yet to be seen.
